Oh! Hello, Internet Stranger. My name **Prasanth** and I'm an aspiring **front end developer**. (That's me on the Left). I'm currently working with JavaScript Environment (Angular, React, Ionic, NodeJs and a few more). Not stoping here, I'm updating myself with Machine Learning and few other things. I'll be sharing samples of some of my work here down the road as i add my skill set, so stay tuned for updates.                                                               
Feel free to contact me with any project proposals.
